# ecommerce_user_behaviour

User behavior in mobile applications depends on many factors and, as a result, varies significantly. To increase sales and revenue, it is necessary to make the right decisions regarding the functionality and design of such applications. Therefore, it is essential to carefully analyze user actions, formulate hypotheses for improving the product, and conduct tests.

This project is aimed at analyzing user behavior in the mobile application of a startup that allows ordering food products. Among the project's goals are:

- General study of user behavior.
- Studying the sales funnel and determining the number of users who have reached the purchase stage, as well as identifying "problematic" steps.
- Analyzing the results of an A/A/B test to make a decision on changing fonts in the application.
